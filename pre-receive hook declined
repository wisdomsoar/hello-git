disable the LFS configuration.
        Settings => General => Visibility, project features, permissions


According the this URL, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support-forum/issues/4310, looks like it’s a defect in the LFS function of the GitLab. 
Someone suggested to disable the LFS but don’t know if any side effect will pop up and if it works or not. 
(Disabling the LFS has to be done by administrator for each project)

See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/10799. The workaround at the moment is to turn off LFS in the project or group settings.
